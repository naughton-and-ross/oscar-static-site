The front-end, static site for the ~~otherwise unnamed~~ project Oscar, now indicitavely called 'ClassFox'.

ClassFox is a class management system designed to be a solution for Australian schools that are currently faced with the problem of disjointed, and incompaitble LMS systems that are built for American schools. 

ClassFox is a comprihensive maangement tool for a students classes, acting as a place to see out the tasks entire lifecycle, typcailly as follows: 

0. (Optional) The task is drafted, refined and agreed-upon in a teacher collaboration group before issuing.

1. The task is issued. 
	* ClassFox notifies all students that the task has been posted. 

2. Submissions for the task are open
	* If the task is a single-submission task, students may recieve a grade based on their submissions. 
	* If the task is a multi-submission task, requiring a draft before a final submissions, teachers respond to a students draft submission, giving feedback and critiques, to allow a student to then continue and submit a final, in which they will be marked on. 
	
3. The grade data is stored and retireved later when generating a report based on that students academic performance.
4. The task is archived.
